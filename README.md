# Word2Vec

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Gensim implementation of Word2Vec and actually get it to work! The training algorithms in this package were ported from the original Word2Vec implementation by Google and extended with additional functionality.

## Usage
Run each cell one after another to got through the Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset 
We use data from the [OpinRank](http://kavita-ganesan.com/entity-ranking-data/) dataset. This dataset has full user reviews of cars and hotels. Each line in this file represents a hotel review.
